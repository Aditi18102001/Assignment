Algorithm:
Hard-3

The code defines a function count_digit_one(n) that calculates the count of digit '1' in the numbers from 1 to n (inclusive). This algorithm is commonly used to solve the "Number of 1 Bits" or similar problems.

Initialization:

Initialize a variable count to 0 to keep track of the count of digit '1'.
Initialize a variable factor to 1, representing the current place value (1, 10, 100, ...).
Loop Through Digits:

While the current place value (factor) is less than or equal to n, continue the loop.
The loop iterates through each digit place (ones, tens, hundreds, etc.).
Calculate Full Groups:

Calculate the number of full groups of 10 that fit in the current place value.
This represents how many times the digit '1' appears at that place value for all full groups.
Calculate Remaining:

Calculate the remaining digit after removing the full groups.
This represents the part of the number that doesn't belong to any full group.
Count 1s in the Current Place Value:

Add the count of digit '1' in the current place value to the overall count.
This includes the contribution from full groups and the remaining digits.
Move to the Next Place Value:

Multiply the factor by 10 to move to the next place value (tens, hundreds, thousands, etc.).
Return the Result:

Once the loop completes, the function returns the total count of digit '1' in the numbers from 1 to n.
